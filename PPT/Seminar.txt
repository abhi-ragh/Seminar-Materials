Introduction
Edge Computing (EC) is an innovative computing paradigm that addresses the challenges posed by the growing number of connected devices and the demand for low-latency, high-bandwidth applications. As industries increasingly rely on real-time data processing, traditional cloud computing models become inadequate, leading to network congestion and inefficiencies. By processing and caching data at the network's edge, EC significantly reduces latency and improves performance for applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and e-Health.
The evolution of Edge Computing has been shaped by earlier technologies like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Cloudlets, which aimed to enhance data delivery and reduce latency. Today, EC integrates various architectures, including Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), and employs enabling technologies such as Edge Intelligence and 5G connectivity.

WHERE IS THE EDGE LOCATED?
As a term, the word ‘‘Edge’’ signifies the extreme part of any
given network. In the case of a telecommunications network,
it refers to the RAN (Radio Access networks) part. While in
the case of the data network (the Internet), the Edge or, more
precisely, the Edge Device (ED) is any extreme end-users or
IoT device (mobile phones, cars, smartwatches, etc.) [6].
However, In EC, the devices responsible for executing
computation tasks are referred to as Edge Servers (ESs) or
Edge nodes (ENs). Those computing devices can exist in
one hope or a few more from the edge devices. Nonetheless,
processing data at the Edge means typically handling it before
it crosses any WAN (Wide Area Networks), knowing that
passing through any WAN denotes a significant data transfer
delay. Supplementary, the nature of an Edge Server varies

I like to visualize edge architectures as a set of layers, which makes the concept easier to understand. Take a look at the diagram below:

In the diagram above, the top layer represents cloud data centers, comprised of a central data center and interconnected regional data centers. The cloud data centers still serve a crucial role in an edge computing architecture because they’re the final repository of information. However, cloud data centers aren’t relied upon for local applications.

The next layer down is the edge layer. The edge could be an oil platform, as in our earlier example, but it could just as easily be a cruise liner, airplane, restaurant, retail shop or mobile medical clinic. The edge layer contains edge data centers and Internet of Things (IoT) gateways. These run on a local area network, which could be fiber, wireless, 5G or older networks such as 4G and earlier.

Within the edge layer, you see individual devices, smart phones, tablets and laptops carried by users, as well as IoT devices that all communicate with the edge data center. There is also communication between devices via a private area network such as RF or Bluetooth.

While this depiction shows a single edge data center for simplicity, there could be n number of additional edge data centers to facilitate computing across a business ecosystem. For example, you might power POS systems for a chain of retail stores using edge data centers in each city where stores are concentrated.
